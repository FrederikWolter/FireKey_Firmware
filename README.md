# FireKey - Software
This student research project named *FireKey* is part of the winter semester 2022 and summer semester 2023 in the Applied Computer Science course at DHBW Mannheim. The aim is to create a macro keyboard with individually configurable keys that allow the input of simple key combinations up to more complex sequences.

This repository is used for developing the software of *FireKey*. The corresponding hardware is developed in the [FireKey_Hardware](https://github.com/FrederikWolter/FireKey_Hardware) repository.
